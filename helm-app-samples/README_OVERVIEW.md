# Helm for Dynamic Kubernetes Deployments: Sample Charts

## Overview

Hi Sam,

As promised, please find attached a sample Helm Chart designed to illustrate how we can effectively manage diverse application deployments on Kubernetes, addressing the specific challenges we discussed.

This sample showcases Helm's capabilities in handling:

* **Conditional Configurations:** Adapting settings based on language (Java, .NET, React, Python).
* **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Setting CPU/memory limits per application type.
* **Flexible Routing & Services:** Managing different hostnames, paths, and ports for UI vs. API applications.
* **Automated Health Checks:** Defining probes dynamically for various technologies.
* **Conditional Resource Creation:** Only deploying ConfigMaps or Secrets when truly needed.

## What's Included

This package contains a single, illustrative Helm Chart named `my-multi-lang-app`.

* **`my-multi-lang-app/`**: This directory is a complete Helm Chart.
    * It contains standard Helm chart files (`Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `templates/`).
    * The `templates/` directory includes templated Kubernetes manifests for a Deployment, Service, Ingress, and a conditional ConfigMap.
    * Inside the `my-multi-lang-app/` directory, you will also find a dedicated `README.md` that provides detailed instructions on how to use and explore this specific chart.

## How to Use the Sample Chart

To explore this sample, you'll need `kubectl` (configured for a Kubernetes cluster) and `helm` installed.

1.  **Extract the package:** Unzip the attached `helm-app-samples.zip` file.
2.  **Navigate to the chart:** `cd helm-app-samples/my-multi-lang-app`
3.  **Review the Chart README:** Open `README.md` inside the `my-multi-lang-app` directory for specific instructions and examples on how to try different language/app type deployments. This README will guide you through installing the chart for a Java app, then a .NET app, and demonstrate how configuration changes.

## Moving Forward

This sample aims to provide a concrete example of the "production standard" approach we discussed. The flexibility and power of Helm mean we can centralize your deployment logic, reduce manual errors, and accelerate your time to market for new features.

We're excited to discuss this further and explore how we can tailor a Helm strategy to your full set of applications.
